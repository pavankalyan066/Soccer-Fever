# Soccer-Fever

Soccer aka Football is the most popular game in the world. It’s a religion of its own. If groups of 10 people can stop time and make people watch them in awe and reverence, it’s this beautiful game. Also, anybody can play soccer- all it needs is 4 poles, a ground and a ball. You can just get started with the play.

In fact, Nelson Mandela very effectively used Football as the unifying factor when he was elected President of South Africa post the Apartheid era. The sport just cuts across all discriminating factors.

We live in ambiguity and always need some information to just make a decision. Decisions are made based on possible outcomes. Win/ Loss/ Pass / Fail etc.

The below problem statement is a classic study for decision-making and understanding the odds stacked against a particular situation.
